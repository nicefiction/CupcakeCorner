 ⭐️
 iOS comes with some fantastic functionality for handling networking ,
 and in particular the `URLSession` class makes it surprisingly easy
 to send
 and receive
 data .
 If we combine that with `Codable`
 to convert Swift objects to and from JSON ,
 and `URLRequest` ,
 which lets us configure exactly how data should be sent ,
 we can accomplish great things in about 20 lines of code .

         Of course, the real question is where to send our request, and I don’t think you really want to set up your own web server in order to follow this tutorial. So, instead we’re going to use a really helpful website called https://reqres.in – it lets us send any data we want, and will automatically send it back. This is a great way of prototyping network code, because you’ll get real data back from whatever you send.
         
         `NOTE`:
         Notice how I added a force unwrap for the `URL(string:)` initializer .
         Creating URLs from strings might fail because you inserted some gibberish ,
         but here I hand-typed the URL
         so I can see it’s always going to be correct
         – there are no string interpolations in there that might cause problems .
